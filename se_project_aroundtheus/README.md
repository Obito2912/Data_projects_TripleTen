**Description**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. It consists on creating a user profile for "320px" and "1280px" screens with the user picture, an "edit" and "add" buttons(to be able to update the profile info) in the header of the page and then the content shows the pictures of the places that the user have visited contained in cards with a description of the photo and a like button(to be able to like it if preferred) next to it. We also see some features that have been added, for example the ability to add new cards, to delete them if wanted; the like button activates when the user clicks on it and deactivate doing the same, the user can also update the profile info, and expand the image when clicking on the card image.

**Improvement**

Things that I have thought about to improve the project would be adding the feature of having shorts and that they can be displayed when hover over the cards or when opening the card modal.
